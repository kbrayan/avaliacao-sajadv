# spring-backend

Spring Back-end application submited for Softplan Admission Challenge.

# Running this application alone

1. Go to project folder (spring-backend) and build the project:
Project build is done inside the container.
 ```./gradlew -x test build
 ```
2. Run project

```java -jar build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar
 ```

2. Access application at localhost::8080

## Development server

1. Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

2. Access application at localhost:4200
